Heya! It's me darkdarcool! 

It's today that I've officially started my blog, and I hope I'll be able to maintain it for a little while.

I tried to make it as easy and automated as possible when designing the system that displays it on my website, so that all I really have to do it create a markdown file with the content and it will automatically deploy everything, so I've decided to make a GitHub repo with all of the content, which you can find [here](https://github.com/darkdarcool/blog/edit/main/test.md).
